# Spotify: Now Playing

This repository contains a simple python script to grab the current song playing on Spotify.exe on Windows.

Over the years, Spotify has changed their application structure breaking existing ways to extract the now playing song.
This script is working as of version `1.1.31.703`.

This code is often used by streamers to show the current playing song when streaming, using software such as OBS, by
dumping the song name to a text file and displaying those file contents as an overlay in the stream.
